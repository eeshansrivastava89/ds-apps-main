## What This Is

A full-stack data science portfolio built in public. Each project is a complete product with real users, production analytics, and published analysis.

**Not** a tutorial site or course platform. Just one person building, documenting, and learning in public, using AI tools to create functional products, deploying to production, and analyzing real behavior.

```

**Main site**: Batch export (1 hour intervals) for pageviews and blog analytics  
**AB Simulator**: Real-time webhooks for immediate game stats updates

## Deployment

**Automated via GitHub Actions:**
- **Fly.io deployment** — Pushes to `main` trigger Docker build and deploy
- **Notebook publishing** — Weekly cron job executes Jupyter notebooks, renders to HTML, commits to repo

All analytics keys and environment variables managed via GitHub Secrets and Fly.io secrets.
