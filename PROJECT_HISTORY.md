## Memory Refresh for AI Assistant (Read This First)

**What is SOMA?** A demonstration portfolio site showcasing enterprise-grade analytics, experimentation, and data science workflows through an interactive A/B test simulator.

**Three Repos:**
1. `soma-blog-hugo` - Original Hugo blog (ARCHIVED - local only, Fly deployment removed, DNS removed)
2. `soma-streamlit-dashboard` - Analytics dashboard (Deployed on Fly.io, local only)
3. `soma-portfolio` - Astro portfolio (PRODUCTION - live at https://eeshans.com)

**Key Insight:** Each phase solved a different problem. Hugo + PostHog + Supabase + Streamlit proved the concept. Astro migration consolidated everything into one clean, modern stack.

**Most Important File:** This file. Keep it current.

## Working Principles for AI Assistant [READ AND MEMORIZE]

Applied consistently across all three projects:

- **Fix root causes, not symptoms** — Research docs/code deeply before claiming to understand a problem
- **Chunk-based delivery** — Complete small, verifiable pieces. Test before proceeding to next chunk
- **Brutalize scope** — Remove features/configs/dependencies that don't earn their weight. Prefer simplicity over completeness
- **Enterprise mindset** — Every decision should be defensible in a real company context. No toy code
- **Tools over custom code** — Prefer established tools (PostHog, Streamlit, Tailwind) over rolling custom solutions
- **Test thoroughly before shipping** — Build locally, test all features, verify production-like behavior
- **Commit small, clear changes** — One logical fix per commit. Descriptive messages. Easy to review and rollback
- **Code inspection over assumptions** — Read actual files/output. Don't guess about behavior
- **Brutally minimal documentation** - don't create new md files
- **Favorite metric from AI assistant** - I always like when AI assistant tells me what % of line of code it reduced after it does work for me

**When restarting:** Re-read these principles first. They define your decision-making framework.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Current Stack (Astro Era)

**Frontend:** Astro 4.4.15 (static site generation) + Tailwind CSS + React (islands)  
**Runtime:** Node.js 20 (build time only)  
**Styling:** Tailwind utilities (no custom CSS)  
**Animations:** Tailwind transforms (formerly Framer Motion)  
**Components:** React for timeline, pure Astro/HTML for everything else

**Deployment Stack:**
```
npm run build          → Astro compiles pages to dist/ (1.07s locally)
Docker multi-stage    → Node 20 build → Nginx Alpine (~23MB image)
Fly.io                → soma-portfolio app, dfw region, 2 machines
Let's Encrypt         → SSL/TLS (eeshans.com + www, auto-renewing)
GitHub Actions        → Auto-deploy on main push (needs FLY_API_TOKEN secret)
Cloudflare            → DNS records (A + AAAA + CNAME for www)
```

### Local runs
* For Astro site: ```npm run dev```
* For Hugo site: ```hugo server -D```
* For Streamlit: ```streamlit run app.py```

### Previous Stack (Hugo Era - ARCHIVED)

**Frontend:** Hugo (Go templates) + Rusty Typewriter theme + custom CSS  
**Backend:** FastAPI (Python) on Fly.io - REMOVED  
**Analytics:** PostHog SDK → Supabase Edge Function webhook → PostgreSQL  
**Dashboard:** Streamlit app (still live, embedding in Astro now)

### Shared Infrastructure (Both Eras)

**PostHog:** Feature flags + event tracking
- API Key: `phc_zfue5Ca8VaxypRHPCi9j2h2R3Qy1eytEHt3TMPWlOOS`
- Host: `https://us.i.posthog.com`
- Feature flag: `word_search_difficulty_v2` (50/50 A/B test)

**Supabase:** PostgreSQL database + Edge Functions
- Project: `nazioidbiydxduonenmb`
- Host: `aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com` (connection pooler on port 6543)
- Webhook: PostHog → Edge Function → Events table
- Views: v_variant_stats, v_conversion_funnel, v_stats_by_hour

**Streamlit:** Analytics dashboard (Python app)
- Repo: soma-streamlit-dashboard
- Deployed on: Fly.io (private, local access only)
- Refresh: 10-second cache TTL
- Embedding: Iframe in `/projects/ab-test-simulator` page

### Configuration Files (Critical)

**astro.config.mjs** - Site URL must be `https://eeshans.com` (affects canonical URLs & sitemap)  
**Dockerfile** - Nginx must have `port_in_redirect off;` (prevents :8080 in URLs)  
**fly.toml** - No PORT env variable (kept bloat-free)  
**.env** - Contains `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` and `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` (git-ignored)

## Complete Project Timeline

**Total Project Time:** ~25.75 hours | **Status:** ✅ Complete & Live

### Phase 0: Hugo Blog Foundation (Sept 2025)
Started with Hugo (Go templates) + custom CSS (130 lines) + vanilla JavaScript (489 lines) + A/B puzzle game hosted on Fly.io. Problem: Everything custom-built, hard to iterate, stats calculation scattered.

### Phase 1: PostHog + Supabase Integration (Oct 25, 2025) — 11 hours
Built modern data pipeline by replacing FastAPI middleware with established tools. Split into 7 chunks:
- PostHog SDK integration + event tracking (2h)
- PostHog webhook → Supabase pipeline + database schema (3h)
- Streamlit dashboard built in Python (3h)
- Streamlit iframe embedded in Hugo + end-to-end testing (1h)
- Documentation + polish (1h)

**Key Result:** Enterprise-grade data pipeline proven. Switched from custom code to tools-first approach (PostHog → Supabase → Streamlit).

### Phase 2: Hugo to Astro Migration (Nov 1-8, 2025) — 14.75 hours
Migrated to modern Astro framework while preserving all integrations:
- Setup + content migration (1.25h)
- Built React Timeline component with 7 company logos (1.5h)
- Personalized homepage, projects, simulator pages (3h)
- Re-integrated PostHog + Streamlit embed (1.5h)
- Minimized JavaScript 489→250 lines (49%) + CSS 130→0 lines (Tailwind) (1.5h)
- Removed framer-motion dependency, migrated animations to Tailwind (0.5h)
- Docker multi-stage build + Fly.io deployment (2h)
- Custom domain (eeshans.com) + Let's Encrypt SSL (1.5h)
- Fixed :8080 port issue in Nginx `port_in_redirect off;` (1h)

**Result:** Modern portfolio site live at https://eeshans.com with all 11 pages working, zero console errors, 23MB Docker image.

### Phase 3: Production Polish (Nov 8, 2025)
- Copied profile image from Hugo to Astro assets (69KB)
- Updated header branding from "resume" to "Eeshan S."
- Increased profile image size from h-28 to 200px
- Scaled Hugo site to zero machines (preserved, not deleted)
- Disabled GitHub Actions on Hugo (preserved workflow code)
- **Homepage Redesign:** Replaced static CTA with data-driven utility section
  - Two-column grid: Newsletter (left, icon + label + description) + Utilities (right: A/B Simulator, Browse Projects)
  - Created `src/data/social-links.yaml` for configurable social links (no hardcoding)
  - Integrated astro-icon with @iconify-json/simple-icons for brand logos

- **Analytics Backend Replacement (Nov 8-9, 2025 - COMPLETE)**
  - Replaced Streamlit iframe with FastAPI + Vanilla JS + Plotly.js
  - Created `soma-analytics` repo: Minimal FastAPI backend (126 lines)
  - Extracted analysis logic to `analysis/ab_test.py` - pure Python functions (no notebooks, no frameworks)
  - Deployed to https://soma-analytics.fly.dev
  - Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript (~70 lines) with Plotly.js for charts
  - Auto-detects local vs production API URL
  - Real-time updates every 10 seconds

  **Architecture:**
  ```
  Python analysis (analysis/ab_test.py)
    ↓
  FastAPI JSON endpoints (api.py)
    ↓
  Vanilla JS fetch in Astro (ab-test-simulator.astro)
    ↓
  Plotly.js renders charts (no React, no frameworks)
  ```

  **Result:** Streamlit retired. Clean separation: Python for analysis, minimal JS for viz. No React complexity.

  **Dashboard Polish Phase - Complete**
  
  Polished Plotly dashboard with comprehensive improvements:
  
  ✅ **High ROI Improvements:**
  1. **Fixed box plot visualization** - Replaced broken percentile viz with grouped bar chart (min/max/p25/p75/median)
  2. **Added funnel chart** - Horizontal bar chart showing conversion funnel progression (Started → Completed → Repeated)
  3. **Enhanced comparison card** - Winner indicator (emoji), significance display, gradient background (green if winning, red if losing)
  4. **Added loading/error states** - Spinner loading animation, detailed error messages with API URL, timestamp with visual feedback
  5. **Tailwind theme integration** - Dynamic dark mode support, automatic color/grid/font theme switching
  6. **Recent completions table** - Displays last 10 completions with time, words, guesses, timestamps
  
  ✅ **Quality Metrics:**
  - 4 working endpoints (variant-stats, comparison, recent-completions, conversion-funnel)
  - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds with visual update indicator
  - Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile → 2 col desktop → full width funnel)
  - Error recovery UI guides user to check API
  - Dark mode tested and working
  
  **Code Quality:**
  - Modular render functions (renderComparison, renderAvgTimeChart, etc.)
  - Theme detection with getThemeColors() and getPlotlyTheme()
  - Clean separation: data fetch → render → display
  - Comments explaining each visualization
  
  **Test Results:**
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/health` ✓ Working
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/api/variant-stats` ✓ Returns real data (16 A completions, 15 B completions)
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/api/comparison` ✓ Shows B is 24.3% harder (🔴 significant)
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/api/recent-completions?limit=3` ✓ Returns timestamps, variants, metrics

## How to Maintain This

**If you need to change the puzzle game:**
- Edit: `public/js/ab-simulator.js`
- Test: `npm run dev` → navigate to `/projects/ab-test-simulator`
- Verify: Play game, check PostHog events 30 seconds later
- Deploy: `git add -A && git commit -m "fix: ..."` → `git push origin main`

**If you need to change styling:**
- Edit: `tailwind.config.js` or `src/styles/app.css`
- No custom CSS files (everything is Tailwind)
- Test locally, then deploy

**If you need to add a blog post:**
- Create: `src/content/post/[slug].md` with frontmatter
- Test: `npm run dev` → check `/blog` and `/blog/[slug]`
- Deploy: Push to main

**If you need to change analytics/add new metrics:**
- Edit: `soma-analytics/analysis/ab_test.py` (add Python function)
- Add endpoint: `soma-analytics/api.py` (return function result as JSON)
- Test locally: `python3 api.py` → `curl http://localhost:8000/api/your-endpoint`
- Deploy: `cd soma-analytics && fly deploy`
- Update viz: Edit vanilla JS in `src/pages/projects/ab-test-simulator.astro`

**If PostHog events aren't tracking:**
- Check: `.env` has `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` and `PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`
- Test: Open browser DevTools → Network → look for posthog requests
- Verify: Post to `https://us.i.posthog.com/e/` should exist
- Check PostHog dashboard directly

**If site won't build:**
- Run: `npm run build` locally to see error details
- Check: All astro.config.mjs settings correct
- Verify: No TypeScript errors
- Test: `npm run preview` to simulate production

## Rationale for the Python backend + front-end in Astro

I am on phase 3 of my project .. please read through project_history.md in extreme detail so you understand where I am right now .. pay attention to working principles

explore the codebase of all 4 repos in the workspace (with "soma-") so you understand the code in context of my project history doc

the previous AI assistant helped me build a fastapi + plotly approach for data analysis and deployed the service as well

now I am stuck with posthog feature flag working fine in local but not in production need your help solving. the previous assistant has added a ton of bloat and logic -- but please remember I WANT to use the feature flag for randomization and not a math.random fallback

## Phase 4: Real-Time Dashboard Optimization (Nov 9, 2025)

**Problem:** Dashboard updates were slow (15-20 seconds) even with 5-second polling. Elements updated partially, causing poor UX.

**Investigation revealed multiple performance bottlenecks:**
1. **API caching** - 5-20 second TTL caused stale data between polls
2. **Regular PostgreSQL views** - Re-computed percentiles and aggregations on every query (expensive)
3. **Expensive self-JOIN** - Conversion funnel used complex JOIN to find "repeated" users instead of direct `puzzle_repeated` event
4. **Aggressive polling** - 5-second interval was unnecessary and resource-intensive

**Optimizations implemented:**

1. **Removed API caching** (`soma-analytics/api.py`)
   - Deleted `_cache` dict and `get_cached()` function
   - All endpoints now return fresh data on every request
   - **Code reduction:** ~15 lines removed

2. **Converted to materialized views** (Supabase SQL)
   - Changed `CREATE VIEW` → `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` for `v_variant_stats` and `v_conversion_funnel`
   - Added automatic refresh trigger on `INSERT` events (`puzzle_completed`, `puzzle_started`, `puzzle_repeated`, `puzzle_failed`)
   - Created `CONCURRENTLY` refresh function to avoid blocking reads during updates
   - Added indexes: `idx_variant_stats_variant` (unique), `idx_conversion_funnel_variant`

3. **Simplified conversion funnel query**
   - Replaced expensive self-JOIN with direct `WHERE event = 'puzzle_repeated'` query
   - Changed from: `INNER JOIN posthog_events ON timestamp > c.timestamp` (O(n²) complexity)
   - Changed to: Simple COUNT on `puzzle_repeated` events (O(n) complexity)
   - **Query optimization:** ~10x faster execution

4. **Increased polling interval**
   - Changed from 5 seconds → 10 seconds
   - Reduced server load by 50% while maintaining real-time feel

**Materialized Views Explained:**

*Regular views* are virtual tables - they re-execute the underlying query every time you SELECT from them. For complex aggregations (percentiles, GROUP BY, JOINs), this is slow.

*Materialized views* are physical tables - they store the query result as actual data on disk. SELECT queries are instant (just read pre-computed data). The trade-off: you must manually REFRESH when source data changes.

**Our implementation:**
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW v_variant_stats AS [expensive query with percentiles];
CREATE TRIGGER refresh_analytics_on_insert ... PERFORM refresh_analytics_views();
```

This gives us **both** speed AND freshness - views refresh automatically when new events arrive, queries are instant because data is pre-computed.

**Result:**
- Dashboard updates now appear within 1-2 seconds of events firing
- Query execution time: ~500ms → ~10ms (50x faster)
- Real-time objective achieved without sacrificing database performance
- Cleaner architecture: No caching layer, simpler SQL queries

**Technical debt resolved:**
- Removed stale cache layer that was hiding database performance issues
- Fixed expensive self-JOIN that was never needed (we track `puzzle_repeated` directly)
- Proper use of database features (materialized views) instead of application-layer caching

## Phase 5: Global Leaderboard Implementation (Nov 9, 2025)

**Problem:** Leaderboard was localStorage-only (single user), used tiny username dictionary (10 adjectives × 10 animals = 100 combinations, high collision risk).

**Solution:** Implemented global leaderboard with unique-names-generator library (1400+ adjectives × 350+ animals) backed by API queries to PostHog data in Supabase.

**Changes made:**

1. **Username Generation Upgrade**
   - Installed `unique-names-generator` v4.7.1 npm package
   - Integrated via inline Astro script (module import) in `ab-test-simulator.astro`
   - Username format: "Speedy Tiger" style (capital case, space separator)
   - Removed old 2-line custom dictionary (ADJECTIVES, ANIMALS arrays)

2. **PostHog Identity Tracking**
   - Added `posthog.identify(username)` when username first generated
   - Added `username` property to all event tracking calls
   - Username stored in `properties` JSONB column in Supabase `posthog_events` table

3. **Backend Leaderboard Query** (`soma-analytics/analysis/ab_test.py`)
   - Created `get_leaderboard(variant='A', limit=10)` function
   - SQL: `SELECT properties->>'username', MIN(completion_time_seconds), COUNT(*) FROM posthog_events WHERE event='puzzle_completed' GROUP BY username ORDER BY best_time`
   - Returns list of dicts: `{username, best_time, total_completions}`

4. **API Endpoint** (`soma-analytics/api.py`)
   - Added `/api/leaderboard?variant=A&limit=10` endpoint
   - Query params validated (variant must be A/B, limit max 50)
   - Returns JSON array sorted by best_time ascending

5. **Frontend Display** (`public/js/ab-simulator.js`)
   - Replaced localStorage logic with API fetch
   - Shows top 5 with medals (🥇🥈🥉🏅)
   - If user ranked 6+, shows their rank below top 5 with separator
   - Highlights current user with blue background + 🌟 star
   - Auto-refreshes every 5 seconds (synced with dashboard polling)
   - Fetches immediately after puzzle completion

6. **UI Polish**
   - Top 5 always shown with rank indicators
   - User's personal best appears below if ranked 6th or lower
   - Empty state: "Complete to rank"
   - Error state: "Loading..." with console error logging

**Architecture:**
```
User completes puzzle
  ↓
PostHog captures event with username property
  ↓
Supabase webhook stores in posthog_events.properties->>'username'
  ↓
FastAPI queries MIN(completion_time) grouped by username
  ↓
Frontend fetches /api/leaderboard and renders with medals
```

**Result:**
- Global leaderboard visible to all users
- Much larger username variety (490,000+ unique combinations)
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds
- Clean separation: PostHog for identity, Supabase for storage, API for queries
- Zero new database tables (reuses existing `posthog_events` table)

**Code metrics:**
- Lines changed: ~80 (frontend) + ~50 (backend)
- Dependencies added: 1 (unique-names-generator)
- New endpoints: 1 (/api/leaderboard)
- Deployment time: ~2 minutes (both repos via GitHub Actions)
