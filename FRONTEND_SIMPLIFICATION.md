# Frontend Simplification: A/B Simulator + Dashboard

This doc is intentionally brief: a pre/post visual and a chunked todo list you can chip away at. No code in here.

## Before (today)

- Page loads global scripts and everything is wired imperatively.
- Fetch logic is embedded where it’s used; `ab-simulator.js` does many jobs at once.
- Plotly powers all charts/tables/funnel; polling is fixed at 5s.

```
[ab-test-simulator.astro]
   |-- utils.js           (globals: $, show/hide/toggle, formatTime)
   |-- puzzle-config.js   (window.PuzzleConfig with puzzles + generators)
   |-- ab-simulator.js    (feature flag, user identity, state, grid rendering,
   |                       countdown/game timers, events, leaderboard fetch/UI)
   |-- dashboard.js       (fetch 4 endpoints, Plotly charts, 5s setInterval)
   v
[Supabase PostgREST]  (direct fetch from dashboard + leaderboard)
[PostHog]             (global, feature flag + capture)
```

## After (current state)

- Single folder for all simulator/dashboard logic: `public/js/ab-sim/`.
- Clear separation: data access (`supabase-api.js`), game + feature flag + events (`core.js`), charts (`dashboard.js`).
- Ready for Phase 2 enhancements (adaptive polling, refresh button) without further structural changes.

```
[ab-test-simulator.astro]
  |-- utils.js              (DOM helpers)
  |-- puzzle-config.js      (puzzle definitions)
  |-- ab-sim/
      |-- supabase-api.js  (RPC/view calls -> window.supabaseApi)
      |-- core.js          (feature flag, state, grid UI, timers, events, leaderboard)
      |-- dashboard.js     (plots + periodic polling)
  v
[Supabase PostgREST]  (all requests via supabaseApi)
[PostHog]             (feature flag + capture inside core.js)
```

## Migration To‑Dos (Phase 1 + Phase 2)

Minimal, incremental steps. You can land each item independently.

### Phase 1 — Organization (complete)

- [x] Supabase API wrapper implemented
- [x] Dashboard & leaderboard refactored to use wrapper
- [x] Interim modular split created (state / featureFlag / puzzle-ui / analytics)
- [x] Consolidated into `public/js/ab-sim/` (final structure) and removed legacy files

Acceptance:
- No behavior changes; same UI, stable build.
- All PostgREST traffic via `window.supabaseApi`.
- Single place (`core.js`) for feature flag, state, events, leaderboard logic.

### Phase 2 — UX & resilience polish

- [ ] Replace fixed `setInterval` with adaptive schedule in `dashboard.js`
  - Success → next poll after 5s; Error → exponential backoff (10s, 20s, up to 60s)
  - Add a small “Refresh” button near “Last updated”
- [ ] Debounce re-render on theme change (avoid double redraw)
- [ ] Add `showFruit(tile, state)` helper to reduce repeated class toggles
- [ ] Optional: only update leaderboard DOM if content changed
- [ ] Add a per-run `game_session_id` to event props for easier grouping

Acceptance for Phase 2:
- Fewer redundant requests on transient errors; manual refresh works.
- Simpler tile-update logic; consistent event properties across events.

## Success Markers

- Single folder `public/js/ab-sim` owns simulator/dashboard logic.
- One Supabase access layer (`supabase-api.js`).
- Game logic encapsulated (`core.js`) with minimal global leakage.
- Ready to implement adaptive polling & UX tweaks without further re-org.

## Tiny Test Plan

- Simulator: run through success/fail flows, verify PostHog events and leaderboard render.
- Dashboard: initial load, theme toggle, manual refresh, network offline → backoff.
- Console: no unhandled promise rejections; errors surfaced as user-friendly messages.
